## Version

This is Version 2.0 of the corpus, as of September 2025. Changes from Version 1.0 to 2.0 are as follows:
- Minimum text length reduced from >8 tokens excl. stop words to >=10 tokens incl. stop words
- CC topic filtering process changed from rudimentary keyword search to automated classification with an XGBoost classifier trained for the task
- Added filtered tweets (inly tweet IDs could be supplied)
- Tokenisation now removes punctuation and retains stop words

The [thesis document](Thesis-Memminger.pdf) contains detailed documentation of the topic filtering process in Version 2.0.

Version 1.0, as of May 30, 2025, and as it was presented at ACL 2025, is also contained as an archive in `data`.
